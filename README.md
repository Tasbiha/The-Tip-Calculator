## Notes

I wass having difficulty with getting a hang of Xcode. Things looked differnt in my xcode than the video walkthorugh.
In addition, my simulator was acting really weird. My Iphone 5 simulator was too big that it could not display the bil Amount
field and I thought something was wrong with my code and I kept re-starting.
